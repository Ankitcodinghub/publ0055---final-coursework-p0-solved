Instructions

Submission Formalities

‚Ä¢ The coursework should be submitted via the ‚ÄòPUBL0055 ‚Äì Assessment 2 ‚Äì 2000 word final paper (70%)‚Äô link on the course Moodle page. You will need to click the ‚ÄòSubmit Paper‚Äô link at the bottom of the page. When presented with the ‚ÄòSubmit Paper‚Äô box, the ‚ÄòSubmission Title‚Äô should be your candidate number, and you should upload your document into the box provided.

‚Äì Please remember to state ONLY your candidate number on your coursework (your candidate number is made up of four letters and one number e.g. ABCD5). Your name and/or studentAssignment Project Exam Help

number MUST NOT appear on your submission.

‚Ä¢ Along with the coursework questions, the necessary data sets for the coursework can be found on the PUBL0055 page on Moodle.

Coursework Formalities

‚Ä¢ The word count for this assessment is 2,000 words. This does not include the code, your output, or any words (or numbers) contained within tables or figures. The word count must be clearly indicated on the first page of the assessment submission. Standard word limit penalties apply.

‚Ä¢ Please submit your type-written (numbered) answers in a single document (preferrably a pdf file, but word files or equivalent are also allowed). Make sure that you include the code, the output (plots, tables etc), and the answers in the document. Double check after uploading your document that all graphs, table, code, and written answers are visible.

‚Ä¢ Unless otherwise stated, answers should be written in complete sentences. Be sure to answer all parts of the questions posed and provide a substantive interpretation of the results.

‚Ä¢ You can integrate the code with the answers (make sure that it is completely visible), as shown for example in the seminar worksheet solutions. Alternatively, you can create an appendix section at the end which contains all the R code needed to reproduce your results.

‚Äì In either case, your code has to work when we run it. You do not need to include the code that failed to run, but just the well-annotated, cleaned-up version.

‚Äì If you do not provide the code to a question which requires it, any written answer to that question will be disregarded.

‚Äì Do not screenshot or copy and paste any brute R output (e.g. lm(y~x)) into your answers. If applicable, create formatted tables that are easy to read.

‚Ä¢ Round all numbers to two or three digits after the decimal point.

‚Ä¢ Assign every table and figure a title and a number and refer to the number in the text when discussing a specific figure or table.

Points will beAssignment Project Exam Helpdeducted for bad presentation, which includes (but is not limited to):

‚Ä¢ Failure to write the answers in full sentences

‚Ä¢ Including screenshots from R output

‚Ä¢ Reporting unrounded numbers

‚Ä¢ Including unnecessary code or output

‚Ä¢ Presenting figures with no or unclear axis labels (or labels that are the unedited variable name in the dataset)

‚Ä¢ Presenting tables that are hard to read/not well formatted

‚Ä¢ Presenting unnumbered and/or untitled tables and figures

‚Ä¢ Referring to the variables in-text by their unedited name from the dataset

Section 1:

Corruption Incidence and Local Health Councils in Brazil

The relationship between well-functioning local institutions and corruption is an important issue across the globe.

To explore the relationship between local governance in the health sector and incidence of corruption, we will conduct some analyses loosely based on the research conducted in Brazil by Avelino, Barberia, and Bilderman (2014).

To measure how established a health council is, Avelino et al. recorded how long a local health council had been established at the time of the audit. Health councils are responsible for overseeing the local provision of health services in the municipality, as well as approving the municipal health budget and monitoring expenditures.

The variables that will be included in the analysis are as follows:

municipality corruption council.age margin reelected transfers poverty Unique code number for municipality

Numeric corruption index (0-100), percent of evidence reports mentioning irregularities

Number of years the health council has been established when the municipality was audited

Margin between the elected mayor and the runner-up candidate in the previous election, in percentage points

Dummy variable that identifies whether the mayor was in their second term at the time of the audit. If so, the value is ‚Äú1‚Äù, otherwise ‚Äú0‚Äù Federal government grants as a share of total health expenditures in the municipality (percentage)

Percentage of individuals below the poverty line

You can download the data set as trading.csv from the PUBL0055 Moodle page. Once you have downloaded this file and placed it in the relevant folder, it can be loaded into R as follows:

brazil &lt;- read.csv(‚Äúdata/brazil.csv‚Äù)

We are first interested in exploring the data set and conducting some descriptive analyses.

We then proceed with a simple linear regression analysis.

a. Fit and present a simple linear regression with the corruption index as the outcome and age of council as the explanatory variable. (1 mark)

c. Under which assumptions can we interpret the regression coefficient as the average effect of council age

a. Fit a multiple linear regression model, adding margin, reelected, and poverty to the model in the previous question. Present this model alongside the simple linear regression model. (1 mark)

Although it was not explored in the original paper, we are interested in whether the relationship between the age of the health council and incidence of corruption differs between municipalities with and without a reelected Mayor.

a. Fit a multiple linear regression model, adding an interaction between reelected and council.age to the multivariate model from the previous question. Present this model alongside the model without the interaction. (1 mark)

Section 2:

Asset trading and attitudes to peace

This section is loosely based on the experiment that Jha &amp; Shayo conducted and uses a (modified) version of the data they collected. You can download the data set as trading.csv from the PUBL0055 Moodle page.

Variable name assettreat asset_comp isrstock palstock tradestock6all

Pre-treatment financial market exposure, 1 if respondent bought/sold shares in the 6 months before the experiment, 0 otherwise

Respondent age (in years) before experiment began

Monthly family income in NIS (New Israeli Shekel) before experiment began

Respondent religion before experiment began

Respondent sex, 1 if respondent is female, 0 otherwise

Respondent education, 1 if respondent had a BA degree or higher before experiment began, 0 otherwise

We will examine whether investing in Israeli or Palestinian stocks affects pro-peace attitudes among Israelis.Assignment Project Exam Help The data set contains the following variables:

Table B14 in the paper‚Äôs B Supplementary Appendix for a list of questions

Variable name Description

p_index_2015 Post-treatment (2015) peace attitudes index, higher values indicate higher support for peace

e_index_2015 Post-treatment (2015) economic policy attitudes index, higher values indicate higher support for more left-leaning economic policy

You can load the data set by using the following command:

trading &lt;- read.csv(‚Äúdata/trading.csv‚Äù)

Data preparation and description:

a. How many individuals received Israeli stocks, how many received Palestinian stocks, and how manyAssignment Project Exam Help

Now we are interested in whether being exposed to financial markets, i.e., trading stocks, affects attitudes to peace.

c. Explain the concept of a ‚Äúsampling distribution‚Äù. What is the shape of the sampling distribution in

c. Test whether randomisation worked properly by examining the balance of two potentially confounding

e. In your analysis in 4.c are you worried more about making a Type I or Type II error? Briefly explain

We could also use this data set to employ a difference-in-differences design.

Considering your findings (your answers to questions 1-4) briefly evaluate the internal and external validity of your results. What do we mean by internal and external validity? Comment on whether and why your findings have high/low external and internal validity.
